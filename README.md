This project analyzes customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify the key factors influencing customer attrition.
The analysis combines traditional business intelligence techniques with AI-assisted features in Power BI to uncover drivers of churn and communicate insights effectively.

The goal is to help stakeholders understand why customers churn and identify actionable retention strategies.

🎯 Business Problem

Customer churn directly impacts revenue and long-term business growth.
The key business questions addressed in this project are:

What is the overall customer churn rate?

Which customer attributes are most associated with churn?

Why is churn higher for certain contract types?

How do services, payment methods, and customer support affect churn?

Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
Description:
The dataset contains customer-level information including:

Contract type

Internet service

Payment method

Tech support availability

Partner and dependents

Gender

Monthly and total charges

Churn status (Yes / No)

🧮 Key Metrics & Measures

The following DAX measures were created to support the analysis:

Total Customers

Churned Customers

Total Churn Rate

Average Monthly Charges

Total Charges

These measures provide a consistent foundation for all visuals and AI-assisted analysis.

🤖 AI-Assisted Features Used (Power BI)

This project intentionally uses Power BI AI features to support analysis and decision-making:

1️⃣ Q&A Visual

Used for natural-language querying of the dataset

Enabled quick exploration such as “Churn rate by contract type”

2️⃣ Key Influencers

Identified which factors have the strongest influence on churn

Highlighted contract type, internet service, and payment method as major drivers

3️⃣ Decomposition Tree

Used as a root-cause analysis tool

Helped explain why churn is higher for month-to-month contracts

4️⃣ Smart Narratives

Automatically generated written insights from visuals

Supported clear communication of findings to non-technical stakeholders

AI features were used for analysis and explanation, while final dashboard visuals focus on clear communication.

📈 Dashboard Overview

The final dashboard focuses exclusively on churn drivers and includes:

Churn Rate by Contract Type

Churn Rate by Internet Service

Churn Rate by Payment Method

Churn Rate by Tech Support

Churn Rate by Partner and Dependents

Churn Rate by Gender

The dashboard design emphasizes clarity, consistency, and business relevance.

🔍 Key Insights

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, indicating low customer commitment.

Customers using fiber optic internet services show significantly higher churn.

Electronic check payment method is associated with higher churn compared to other methods.

Customers without tech support churn more than those with support.

Customers with partners or dependents tend to churn less.

💡 Business Recommendations
